  <h1 class="topictitle1">Localization Files Editor</h1>

  
  
  <div><p>Allows you to easily create text string files for new locales, to see which strings will be used in a given
    locale, and to identify strings that have yet to be translated, all without having to work directly in XML-formatted
    files.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To start the Localization Files Editor, simply double-click one of the XML files containing the strings to be
        localized (or an XML file containing the localized strings). Within an Android project, the base strings file is
        res/values/strings.xml. </p>

      <div class="p">The Localization Files Editor should open, showing all of the strings and string arrays defined in each of the
          <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files in your project's resources directory. If it does not, open it as
          follows:<ol>
          <li>Right-click one of the the XML files containing localized strings.</li>

          <li>From the context-sensitive menu select <span class="menucascade">
              <span class="uicontrol">Open With</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span>
            </span>.</li>

          <li>In the Editor Selection dialog select <span class="uicontrol">Localization Files Editor</span>.</li>

        </ol>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Localization Files Editor forces every project to have a default values file (values.xml). If
          your project doesn't have one, when you open the editor this file will be created with empty keys.</div>
</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The editor</h2>
      
      <p>The Localization Files Editor consists primarily of a table in which each row is identified by a key (or, for
        an array entry, a key and an array index) and each column (except the first, which contains the keys and
        indexes) represents a locale. Each locale column corresponds to a <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file within a
        directory named for that locale. The table cells represent key/value pairs within the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files. Wherever a cell contains a value, the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file
        corresponding to the cell's column defines that value for the key corresponding to the cell's row. This tabular
        presentation allows you to quickly see, for a single key, the strings that will be displayed in each supported
        locale. It also makes evident those strings that don't have a value defined specifically for that locale.</p>

      <p>The following actions can be performed by clicking the icons arrayed across the top of the table:</p>

      <table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <img src="../images/loc_editor-add-string-button.png"/></td>

          <td valign="top">Adds a new table row (or rows, if you click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the icon and
            specify a number of rows to be added) representing a string to be localized. Each new row will initially
            have a default key value; replace this value with the key by which the string should be
          referenced.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img src="../images/loc_editor-add-array-button.png"/></td>

          <td valign="top">Adds to the table a string array (an array of strings collectively identified by a single key; each
            string is then accessed using an integer index value). Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the
            icon and specify a number to add multiple arrays at once. Each new array will initially have a default key
            value; replace this value with the key by which the array should be referenced. As created an array will
            only have a single entry; use <img src="../images/loc_editor-add-array-item-button.png"/> (Add Array
            Item) to add additional entries to the array.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img src="../images/loc_editor-add-array-item-button.png"/></td>

          <td valign="top">Available only when you have selected an array, this command adds a new entry to the end of the
            array. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the icon and specify a number to add multiple
            entries to the array.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top">

          <td valign="top">Deletes the selected keys and their associated values from each of the XML strings files in your
            project that specify a value for those keys. Note that even locales whose corresponding columns are hidden
            are affected. If an individual array item is selected when you issue this command, that item is deleted. If
            the table row containing an array's key is selected, the entire array is deleted.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img src="../images/loc_editor-collapse-all-button.png"/></td>

          <td valign="top">Collapses all arrays to a single table row, hiding those rows corresponding to each array's entries.

        <tr>

            (Undo).</td>

        </tr>

      </table>

      <p>Within an Android project, you have a file that contains base, or default, values for each key: these values
        can be found in <span class="filepath">res/values/strings.xml</span> (if this file does not exist, it is created for you
        with blank values when you open the Localization Files Editor). These default values are used for string
        resources that aren't specifically defined for a given locale.</p>

      <p>If you prefer, you can view and edit the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files as XML: the tabs across the
        bottom of the view containing the Android Localization Files Editor allow direct access to the files. The
        various tabs are kept in sync, such that changes made in the Localization Files Editor appear immediately in the
        corresponding strings.xml tab, and changes made to an XML file in one of the strings.xml tabs are immediately
        reflected in the Android Localization Files Editor.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Options</h2>
      
      <p>The Localization Files Editor options are displayed immediately above the table. Normally these options are not
        displayed, to allow the table to occupy most of the view. Click the disclosure triangle next to the word
          <span class="uicontrol">Options</span> to show or hide the editor options. The Localization Files Editor has the
        following options:</p>

      <table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">

          </td>

          <td valign="top">When selected, the table rows expand vertically to accommodate multiple lines of text. All table rows
            expand to the same height: the height required by the row with the most lines of text in one cell. Clear
            this option to view the table at its most compact, with only a single line of text showing for each row.
            Note that this option only affects how the row is presented in the Localization Files Editor; a cell can
            contain more text than is initially displayed.</td>

        </tr>

            cell (without clicking) in which the string value is defined. The text box that presents the comment is
            editable; simply click within the comment to edit it.</td>

      </table>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Cell comments</h2>For each key/value pair defined for a given locale, you can also add a comment.
      If <span class="uicontrol">Show Cell Comments</span> is enabled (you may need to click <span class="uicontrol">Options</span> to
      see or change the state of this option), simply hover over a cell (without clicking) in which a value is defined
      and a floating text box will appear in which you can enter your comment or view the comment currently attached to
      the cell. Note that there must be a value in the cell in order to comment on it; you cannot apply comments to
      empty cells. Within the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file, the comment is attached to the string value like
        this:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;string name="app_name"&gt;Internationalisation Test&lt;!--This is the name of the app--&gt;&lt;/string&gt;</pre>
<p>If you delete the contents of a cell, any comments applied to that cell are also deleted.</p>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Context-sensitive commands</h2>
      
      <p>Right-click within the table to bring up a menu of commands. Note that many of these commands correspond to the

            XML strings files in your project; those with check marks preceding them will be shown. Below the column
