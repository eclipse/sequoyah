  <div><p>After installing the Android NDK and a few other needed components, Eclipse can be configured to let you
    develop Android applications that include native (C/C++) code.</p>

    <div class="p">Native support requires that the following be installed:<ul>
        <li>The Eclipse CDT plugin (version 7 or later)</li>

        <li>The Sequoyah Android feature</li>

        <li>Android NDK</li>

        <li>Cygwin (only on systems running Microsoft Windows)</li>

        <li>The Java JDK (the JRE is not sufficient; you need the full JDK)</li>

      </ul>
<p>Your development computer's system path (not the Eclipse path) should include the directory containing the
        Android NDK, and, on Microsoft Windows, the directory containing the Cygwin binaries.</p>
<p>For instructions on
        locating and installing the above components, and on setting your computer's system path, see the <em>MOTODEV
          Studio for Android Installation Guide</em>.</p>
</div>

    <div class="section"/>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Specify the location of the NDK from within your development environment: navigate to the <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Android</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Android NDK</span></span> preferences page and
          specify the path to the directory containing the NDK using the <span class="uicontrol">NDK Location</span>
        field.</span>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <div class="section">Now that you have configured your development environment to enable native development, enable it in those
      Android projects that have (or will have) native code.</div>
