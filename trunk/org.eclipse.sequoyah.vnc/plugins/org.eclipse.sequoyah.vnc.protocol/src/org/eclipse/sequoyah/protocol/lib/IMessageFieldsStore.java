 * DESCRIPTION: This interface describes the contract to be followed by an
 * object which purpose is to store message fields. <br>
 * 
 * RESPONSIBILITY: Define methods that shall be implemented by objects that
 * store message fields, so that a user can query for field values.<br>
 * 
 * COLABORATORS: MessageFieldsStore: default implementor of the interface.<br>
 * 
 * USAGE: The implementer class is intended to be instantiated by the protocol
 * framework. The user can query the IMessageFieldsStore for message field
 * values by using any of the method of this interface.<br>
